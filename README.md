# Rusty Engine

Rusty Engine is a simple, 2D game engine for those who are learning Rust. Create simple game prototypes using straightforward Rust code without needing to learning difficult game engine concepts! It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Rusty Engine is a simplification wrapper over [Bevy], which I encourage you to use directly for more serious game engine needs.

[Questions], [bug reports], and contributions are most welcome!

## Courses

If you like Rusty Engine, please sponsor me [on GitHub] or [on Patreon], or take one of my courses below!

The following courses use Rusty Engine in their curriculum:

- [Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/?referralCode=8ED694EBE5637F954414) on Udemy (the sequel to [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0))
- [Rust in 3 Weeks](https://agileperception.com) conducted live on O'Reilly Online approximately once each quarter.

## Linux Dependencies (Including WSL 2)

If you are using Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, please visit Bevy's [Installing Linux Dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md) page and follow the instructions to install needed dependencies.

## Quick Start

### You MUST download the assets separately!!!

Here are three different ways to download the assets (pick any of them--it should end up the same in the end):
- Clone the `rusty_engine` repository and copy/move the `assets/` directory over to your own project
- Download a [zip file](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or [tarball](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz) of the `rusty_engine` repository, extract it, and copy/move the `assets/` directory over to your own project.
- (My favorite!) On a posix compatible shell, run this command inside your project directory:
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -zxv --strip-components=1 rusty_engine-main/assets
```

Add `rusty_engine` as a dependency

```toml
# In your [dependencies] section of Cargo.toml
rusty_engine = "5.1.1"
```

Write your game!

```rust
// in src/main.rs
 use rusty_engine::prelude::*;

 // Define a struct to hold custom data for your game (it can be a lot more complicated than this one!)
 struct GameState {
     health: i32,
 }

 fn main() {
     // Create a game
     let mut game = Game::new();
     // Set up your game. `Game` exposes all of the methods and fields of `Engine`.
     let sprite = game.add_sprite("player", SpritePreset::RacingCarBlue);
     sprite.scale = 2.0;
     game.audio_manager.play_music(MusicPreset::Classy8Bit, 1.0);
     // Add one or more functions with logic for your game. When the game is run, the logic
     // functions will run in the order they were added.
     game.add_logic(game_logic);
     // Run the game, with an initial state
     let initial_game_state = GameState { health: 100 };
     game.run(initial_game_state);
 }

 // Your game logic functions can be named anything, but the first parameter is always a
 // `&mut Engine`, and the second parameter is a mutable reference to your custom game
 // state struct (`&mut GameState` in this case).
 //
 // This function will be run once each frame.
 fn game_logic(engine: &mut Engine, game_state: &mut GameState) {
     // The `Engine` contains all sorts of built-in goodies.
     // Get access to the player sprite...
     let player = engine.sprites.get_mut("player").unwrap();
     // Rotate the player...
     player.rotation += std::f32::consts::PI * engine.delta_f32;
     // Damage the player if it is out of bounds...
     if player.translation.x > 100.0 {
         game_state.health -= 1;
     }
 }
```

Run your game with `cargo run --release`!
