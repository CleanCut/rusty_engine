# Rusty Engine

Rusty Engine is a simple, 2D game engine for those who are learning Rust. Create simple game prototypes using straightforward Rust code without any advanced game engine concepts! It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Rusty Engine is a simplification wrapper over [Bevy], which I encourage you to use directly for more serious game engine needs.

[Questions], [bug reports], and contributions are most welcome!

## Features

- Sprites (2D images)
  - Includes 2 built-in asset packs
- Audio (music & sound effects)
  - Includes 2 built-in asset packs
- Collision detection
- Text
  - Includes 2 built-in fonts
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse)
- Timers

## Courses

I teach courses which use this game engine:

- `Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts` on Udemy, etc. Coming soon!
- [Rust in 3 Weeks](https://agileperception.com) conducted live on O'Reilly Online.

### Linux Dependencies (Including WSL 2)

If you are using Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, please visit Bevy's [Installing Linux Dependencies](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md) page and follow the instructions to install needed dependencies.

### Using Rusty Engine

Download the asset packs (unless you don't want to use any assets):
* Clone the `rusty_engine` repository and copy/move the `assets/` directory over to your own project
* Download a [zip file](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or [tarball](https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz) of the `rusty_engine` repository, extract it, and copy/move the `assets/` directory over to your own project.
* On a posix compatible shell, run this command inside your project directory:
```shell
curl -L https://github.com/CleanCut/rusty_engine/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -zxv --strip-components=1 rusty_engine-main/assets
```

Add `rusty_engine` as a dependency

```toml
# In your [dependencies] section of Cargo.toml
rusty_engine = "0.13.0"
```

Write your game!

```rust
// In main.rs
use rusty_engine::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut game = Game::new();
    // Use `game` to initialize starting state.
    let race_car: &mut Actor = game.add_actor("race car", ActorPreset::RacingCarRed);
    race_car.translation = Vec2::new(-100.0, -100.0);
    race_car.rotation = NORTH_EAST;
    race_car.scale = 2.0;
    // Then do `game.run()` to start the game.
    game.run(game_logic);
}

// This function is called once per frame
fn game_logic(game_state: &mut GameState) {
    // Your game logic goes here
}

```
