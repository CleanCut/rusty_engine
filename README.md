# Rusty Engine

Rusty Engine is a simple, 2D game engine for those who are learning Rust. Create simple game prototypes using straightforward Rust code without any advanced game engine concepts! It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Rusty Engine is a simplification wrapper over [Bevy], which I encourage you to use directly for more serious game engine needs.

[Questions], [bug reports], and contributions are most welcome!
