## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Changed

- Gut the entire project and started over by wrapping [Bevy] with a simple interface for beginners to use.
- Implement the following features: GameState, Actors w/Transform handling, Sprites w/asset pack, audio sfx/music with asset pack, timer utility.
- Add a release config and release doc

## 0.0.1 - [0.11.0]

- Rapid, messy development based on gfx via `glium`, sound via `rusty_audio`, timing via `rusty_time`, and custom logic for everything else.  This approach never reached a very usable state.
