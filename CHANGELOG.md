## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Changed

- Gutted the entire project and started over by wrapping [Bevy] with a simple interface for beginners to use.

## 0.0.1 - 0.11.0

- Rapid, messy development based on gfx via `glium`, sound via `rusty_audio`, timing via `rusty_time`, and custom logic for everything else.  This approach never reached a very usable state.
