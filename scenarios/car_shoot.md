# Car Shoot

Cars are floating past. Shoot them down!

You are at a carnival booth. Cars float across the back of the booth, occasionally obscured by obstacles. The player uses their marble gun to shoot down as many of the cars as possible before the time runs out.

This scenario can be extended to 2 players.

1. Create your project and add `rusty_engine` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`
