# Space Invaders!

Evil aliens are invading! Shoot them down.

Similar to the classic [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) arcade game, evil aliens are invading and you must shoot them down!  Aliens will be set up in a grid near the top of the screen. They will march back and forth the screen as they come lower and lower, moving faster the less of them that there are.  You are aboard the only spaceship left that can shoot them down!
