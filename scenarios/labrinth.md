# Labrinth

Guide the marble from the beginning to the end of the labrinth...but don't fall in any holes!

This game consists of a [Labrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth) or maze with a beginning and an end.  The marble starts at the beginning of the labrynth (naturally) and must proceed to the end. Sounds easy...until you realize that there are holes all along the maze, and you don't have perfect control of the marble! If you fall in one of the holes, start over from the beginning.
