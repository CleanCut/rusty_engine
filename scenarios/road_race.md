# Road Race

How far can you race without running into obstacles?

Race your car (or cars) down the road.  Your car (or cars) are on the left side of the screen facing towards the right side, and are continuously driving down a road. The road sways back and forth, indicated by the borders of the road going up or down. Hitting side barriers or obstacles in the road ends your race.

This scenario can be extended to 2 players.
