# Cannon Practice

Cannons are the perfect toy for playing with ballistic trajectories!

In this scenario you will create a cannon that sits on the bottom left side of the screen. You will be able to aim the cannon and choose how much gunpowder to use. The cannonball will follow a ballistic trajectory across the screen.  Avoid various obstacles and hit your targets to score points!
