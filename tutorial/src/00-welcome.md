# Welcome to Rusty Engine!

Rusty Engine is a simple, 2D game engine for those who are learning Rust. Create simple game prototypes using straightforward Rust code without needing to learning difficult game engine concepts! It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Rusty Engine is a simplification wrapper over [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), which I encourage you to use directly for more serious game engine needs.

The following courses use Rusty Engine in their curriculum:

- [Ultimate Rust 2: Intermediate Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-2/?referralCode=8ED694EBE5637F954414) on Udemy (the sequel to [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0))
- [Rust in 3 Weeks](https://agileperception.com) conducted live on O'Reilly Online approximately once each quarter.
