# Welcome to Rusty Engine!

Rusty Engine is a game engine for writing simple 2D game prototypes in Rust.  It is often paired
with projects for crash courses such as the [Ultimate Rust Crash Course].  The goal of Rusty Engine
is to abstract away most of the complexities of a game engine so you can focus on learning Rust
while making a simple game.

You are welcome to keep tinkering with Rusty Engine once you have a solid grasp of Rust, of course,
but we won't be surprised if you move on to a more fully-featured game engine such as [Amethyst]
